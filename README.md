This repository contains the **marketing site for Sites By Collier**, a web development and funnel agency offering websites, conversion funnels, hosting, and ongoing optimization services.  

The site is built as a **static HTML/CSS project**, designed to showcase services, pricing, and provide a clear point of contact for potential clients.
